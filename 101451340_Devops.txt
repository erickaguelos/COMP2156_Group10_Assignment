DevOps is a combination of software development (dev) and operations (ops).
It is defined as a software engineering methodology which aims to integrate the work of development teams and operations teams by facilitating a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility.
DevOps fosters collaboration and communication among cross-functional teams, breaking down silos between development, operations, and other stakeholders.
DevOps emphasizes real-time monitoring and logging to detect and address issues promptly, contributing to improved system reliability and performance.
DevOps practices aim to create scalable and resilient systems, accommodating changes in demand and ensuring optimal performance.
