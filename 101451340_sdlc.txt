The software development lifecycle (SDLC), a time- and money-efficient method, to design and create high-quality software.
The Software Development Life Cycle, or SDLC, is a process that generates software at the lowest feasible cost and with the greatest quality in the quickest amount of time.

These are a few advantages of SDLC:

improved transparency of the development process for all concerned parties 
Effective scheduling, planning, and estimating 
enhanced cost estimate and risk management 
Streamlined software delivery and increased client satisfaction

To assist organisations in implementing software development lifecycle (SDLC) practices, a theoretically organised presentation of SDLC is provided via SDLC models. To maximise the development cycle, different models place the SDLC phases in different chronological sequences.
